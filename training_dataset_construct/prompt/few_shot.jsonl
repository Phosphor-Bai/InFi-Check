It also helps organizing the content of medical records, reducing the variability in the way data is captured, encoded and used for clinical care of patients and research.\nClinicians and organizations use different clinical terms that mean the same thing. For example, the terms heart attack, myocardial infarction, and MI may mean the same thing to a cardiologist, but, to a computer, they are all different. There is a need to exchange clinical information consistently between different health care providers, care settings, researchers and others (semantic interoperability),and because medical information is recorded differently from place to place (on paper or electronically), a comprehensive, unified medical terminology system is needed as part of the information infrastructure.\nSNOMED CT is a compositional concept system, which means that concepts can be specialized by combinations with other concepts. It is based on Description Logic and is designed so that content can be maintained as a dynamic resource.\nSuch expressions are said to have been 'post-coordinated' by contrast with the set of entities already included in a given SNOMED CT release, which are normally collectively labeled 'pre-coordinated' concepts, even though the majority (85%) of these pre-coordinated concepts are currently in fact primitive entities.\nNB: in other contexts or projects 'coordination' may refer not to the specification of a candidate new expression but rather to the subsequent operation of integrating one within the polyhierarchy (ie classifying it). In SNOMED CT terminology, saying that an expression has been 'post-coordinated' does not imply that it has also been classified.\nReliable analysis and comparison of any such post-coordinated expressions - with respect to both those concepts already within the SNOMED CT release dataset and any other ad hoc concepts created or yet to be created by its community of end users - properly requires the application of an appropriate description logic classification algorithm.\nThe logic may be extended in the near future to include General Concept Inclusion Axioms.\nIn theory, description logic reasoning can be applied to any new candidate post-coordinated expressions in order to assess whether it is a parent or ancestor of, a child or other descendent of, or semantically equivalent to any existing concept from the 370,000 pre-coordinated concepts which are already distributed worldwide. However, partly as the continuing fall-out from the merger with CTV3, SNOMED content in 2007 still contains undiscovered semantically duplicate primitive and defined concepts. Additionally, many concepts remain primitive whilst their semantics can also be legitimately defined in terms of other primitives and roles concurrently in the system. Because of these ommissions and actual or possible redundancies of semantic content, real-world performance of algorithms to infer subsumption or semantic equivalence will be unpredictably imperfect.\nThe benefit of recording information in a standard terminology such as SNOMED CT is linked to the benefits of the electronic care record and the benefits of recording clinical information in a structured form\nSNOMED CT is one of a suite of designated data standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information.\nIn January 2002, SNOMED CT was created by the merger, expansion, and restructuring of SNOMED RT (Reference Terminology) and the UK National Health Service (NHS) Clinical Terms Version 3 (also known as the Read Codes). The historical strength of SNOMED RT was its terminologies for specialty medicine and methods for distributed collaborative development, while the strength of Clinical Terms Version 3 was its terminologies for general practice. By combining these two systems, SNOMED CT is the most comprehensive clinical vocabulary available in any language, covering most aspects of clinical medicine with over 344,000 concepts. SNOMED CT cross maps to such other terminologies as ICD-9-CM, ICD-O3, ICD-10, Laboratory LOINC and OPCS-4. It supports ANSI, DICOM, HL7, and ISO standards. In April 2002, the SNOMED CT Spanish Edition was released, and in April 2003 the SNOMED CT German Edition was released.\nThe National Library of Medicine (NLM), on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, entered into an agreement with College of American Pathologists for a perpetual license for the core SNOMED CT (in Spanish and English) and ongoing updates. The contract provides to NLM a perpetual license to distribute SNOMED within the NLM's Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus for no cost use within the U.S. by both U.S. government (federal, state, local, and territorial) and private organizations. The contract also covers updates to SNOMED CT issued by the College of American Pathologists between June 30, 2003 and June 29, 2008.\nIn April 2007, SNOMED CT was acquired by IHTSDO, The International Healthcare Terminology Standards Development Organization.\nSummary:\nSNOMED CT is a comprehensive, computer-processable medical terminology system covering clinical information such as diseases, procedures, and pharmaceuticals. It facilitates consistent data indexing, storage, retrieval, and aggregation across specialties and care sites, aiding in semantic interoperability among healthcare providers and researchers. SNOMED CT, created in January 2002 from the merger of SNOMED RT and the UK NHS Clinical Terms Version 3, includes over 344,000 concepts and supports standards like ANSI, DICOM, HL7, and ISO. It allows for compositional concept specialization using Description Logic, enabling both pre-coordinated and post-coordinated expressions. Despite its extensive coverage, SNOMED CT faces challenges with semantic duplicates and primitive concepts. It holds a perpetual license for SNOMED CT, facilitating its use within the U.S. The system was acquired by IHTSDO in April 2007. SNOMED CT editions in Spanish and German were released in April 2002 and April 2003, respectively, and it cross-maps to terminologies like ICD-9-CM and LOINC.\n<|end_header_id|>:The following part is not supported by the origin document:\n- Location: The error occurs in the following sentence: It holds a perpetual license for SNOMED CT, facilitating its use within the U.S. Specifically, 'It'.\n- Explanation: The incorrect pronoun 'It' was used to refer to The National Library of Medicine, falsely suggesting that an unspecified entity holds the license instead of the actual organization.\n- Correction: The National Library of Medicine holds a perpetual license for SNOMED CT, facilitating its use within the U.S.\n- Error Type: Co-reference Error\nTherefore, the answer is YES."}

It may be used to market a service or a product.\nMarketing a service-base business is different from marketing a product-base business.\nThere are several major differences, including:\nWhat is marketing? Marketing is the flow of goods and services from the producer to consumer. It is based on relationship and value. In common parlance it is the distribution and sale of goods and services.\nMarketing includes the services of all those indulged may it be then the wholesaler retailer, Warehouse keeper, transport etc. In this modern age of competition marketing of a product or service plays a key role. It is estimated that almost 50% of the price paid for a commodity goes to the marketing of the product in US. Marketing is now said to be a term which has no particular definition as the definitions change everyday.\n\"Managing the evidence\" refers to the act of informing customers that the service encounter has been performed successfully. It is best done in subtle ways like providing examples or descriptions of good and poor service that can be used as a basis of comparison. The underlying rationale is that a customer might not appreciate the full worth of the service if they do not have a good benchmark for comparisons.\nHowever, it is worth remembering that many of the concepts, as well as many of the specific techniques, will work equally well whether they are directed at products or services. In particular, developing a marketing strategy is much the same for products and services, in that it involves selecting target markets and formulating a marketing mix. Thus, Theodore Levitt suggested that \"instead of talking of 'goods' and of 'services', it is better to talk of 'tangibles' and 'intangibles'\" . Levitt also went on to suggest that marketing a physical product is often more concerned with intangible aspects (frequently the 'product service' elements of the total package) than with its physical properties. Charles Revson made a famous comment regarding the business of Revlon Inc.: 'In the factory we make cosmetics. In the store we sell hope.' Arguably, service industry marketing merely approaches the problems from the opposite end of the same spectrum .\nSummary:\nServices marketing focuses on relationship and value, differing from product-based marketing. It involves the flow of goods and services from producer to consumer, including roles like wholesalers and retailers. In the U.S., marketing can account for nearly 50% of a product's price. 'Managing the evidence' helps customers recognize service value by providing benchmarks for comparison. Marketing strategies for products and services are similar, involving target markets and a marketing mix. Theodore Levitt suggested viewing marketing in terms of 'tangibles' and 'intangibles,' noting that product marketing often emphasizes intangible aspects. Charles Revson of Revlon highlighted this by stating, 'In the factory we make cosmetics. In the store we sell hope,' illustrating the intangible focus in marketing.\n<|end_header_id|>:All statements in the summary align with the content of the original document.\nTherefore, the answer is NO."}

The battle also included troops from the Kingdom of Dahomey, a vassal of Oyo.\nDuring the 18th century, the Ashanti Empire was beset by a host of rebellions due in large part to the empire's policy of allowing conquered rulers a fair amount of autonomy as long as they paid tribute and provided military contingents when ordered. The asantethene during this period was Kusi Oboadum, who had ascended the throne in 1750. During his reign, the southern states under Asante's influence such as Denkyira, Wassa, Twifo and Akyem became openly hostile and threatened the empire's commercial routes to the coast. This was not only a threat to Asante's commercial interests but to its national security, since its supply of firearms came from the coast.\nIn 1763, the Asante vassal state of Akyem made contact with the Kingdom of Dahomey while planning a rebellion with other dissident within the empire including the Kwahu and Brong. Meanwhile, the bantamahene, one of the major Asante military officers,  had been relentlessly pressuring Asantethene Kusi Oboadum for war. Bantamahene Adu Gyamera had even gone so far as to threaten the ruler's impeachment. The asantethene did not order an invasion, however, until learning that the Akyem had sought out aid from the Oyo Empire.\nSometime in 1764, the Asante army marched out to invade the Dahomey. It is unknown how large this force or even how large the opposing army was. What historians are sure of is that the army was ambushed in or near Atakpamé in what is now Togo. A force of Dahomean infantry including the kingdom's elite Ahosi corps of female soldiers as well as levies from the Oyo Empire inflicted a crushing defeat on the Asante army. During the battle, the Juabenhene (head of the royal clan of Oyoko) was killed. The Asante army never reached Dahomey and was forced to retreat.\nNews reached European merchants trading with the Yoruba that Oyo had inflicted a severe defeat on the Asante. The consequences would be far reaching in that the unpopular asantethene would be removed for the more youthful Osei Kwadwo.\nSummary:\nThe Battle of Atakpamé in 1764 was a significant conflict between the Ashanti Empire and the Oyo Empire near Atakpamé, Togo, involving Dahomean troops. The Ashanti, led by Asantethene Kusi Oboadum, faced internal rebellions due to their policy of granting autonomy to conquered rulers. Southern states like Denkyira and Akyem threatened Ashanti's trade routes. In 1750, Akyem contacted Dahomey while planning a rebellion, and later sought aid from Oyo, prompting the Asante to plan an invasion in 1764. The Asante army suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Dahomean infantry, including the elite Ahosi female corps, and Oyo Empire levies. The Juabenhene was killed, and the Ashanti retreated. This defeat led to the removal of the unpopular asantethene, who was replaced by the more youthful Osei Kwadwo.\n<|end_header_id|>:The following part is not supported by the origin document:\n- Location: The error occurs in the following sentence: In 1750, Akyem contacted Dahomey while planning a rebellion, and later sought aid from Oyo, prompting the Asante to plan an invasion in 1764.

SNOMED CT, created in January 2002 from the merger of SNOMED RT and the UK NHS Clinical Terms Version 3, includes over 344,000 concepts and supports standards like ANSI, DICOM, HL7, and ISO. It allows for compositional concept specialization using Description Logic, enabling both pre-coordinated and post-coordinated expressions. Despite its extensive coverage, SNOMED CT faces challenges with semantic duplicates and primitive concepts. The National Library of Medicine holds a perpetual license for SNOMED CT, facilitating its use within the U.S. The system was acquired by IHTSDO in April 2007. SNOMED CT editions in Spanish and German were released in April 2002 and April 2003, respectively, and it cross-maps to terminologies like ICD-9-CM and LOINC.\n<|end_header_id|>:The following part is not supported by the origin document:\n- Location: The error occurs in the following sentence: SNOMED CT is a comprehensive, computer-processable medical terminology system ignoring clinical information such as diseases, procedures, and pharmaceuticals.
