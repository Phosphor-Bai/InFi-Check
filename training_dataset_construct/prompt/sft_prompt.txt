Your task is to evaluate a summary by comparing it to the original document and identifying any errors present in the summary. These errors may involve incorrect information, over-simplifications, misrepresentations, or other discrepancies. Below are the possible types of errors you should consider:
- Semantic Frame Errors: Predicate Error, Entity Error, Circumstance Error
- Discourse Errors: Co-reference Error, Discourse Link Error

You are provided with the full text of the original document, and a summary of the document that might contain errors.

You should output:
1. Analyze the content of the summary compared to the original document. For each identified error, provide:
- Location: Where the error occurs in the summary.
- Explanation: Why the original meaning is altered.
- Correction: A revised version of the erroneous part of the summary.
- Error Type: Specify the exact error type based on the categories listed above.
2. Answer whether the summary contains errors that make it not fully supported by the document.
