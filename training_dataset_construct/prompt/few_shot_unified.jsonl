Sales climbed 8% for the year, the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added. The gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.\nThe increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn). Sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion However, if automotives are excluded from December's data, retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. Home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well, rising 2.2%. But as well as hitting the shops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. However, analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the Federal Reserve Bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises. \"Consumers for now remain willing to spend freely, sustaining the US expansion. Given that attitude, the Fed remains likely to continue boosting the Fed funds rate at upcoming meetings,\" UBS economist Maury Harris told Reuters.\nRetail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US. Consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the World Trade Centre attacks. During that time, sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. Looking ahead, analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the High Street with consumer spending remaining strong. The belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. The number of Americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367,000, the highest rate since September. However, long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001.\nSummary:\nUS retail sales saw significant gains in December, with a 1.2% increase, driven by strong car sales, which rose 4.3% as dealers offered discounts. This surge contributed to an 8% annual sales increase, the best since 1999, according to the Commerce Department. December's total spending reached $349.4 billion, and annual sales surpassed $4 trillion for the first time. Excluding autos, December sales rose 0.3%, with home furnishings up 2.2% and non-store retailers up 1.9%. Despite strong sales, the Federal Reserve is expected to continue its measured interest rate hikes. Retail sales are crucial to consumer spending, which constitutes two-thirds of US economic output. Consumer spending has rebounded since the early 2000s recession, despite a recent rise in unemployment claims to 367,000. They anticipate job growth will sustain consumer spending, despite mixed labor market signals.\n<|end_header_id|>:[{'summary sentence': 'US retail sales saw significant gains in December, with a 1.2% increase, driven by strong car sales, which rose 4.3% as dealers offered discounts.', 'related sentence(s) from the document': ['US retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in December, boosted by strong car sales.', 'Seasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month, compared to 0.1% a month earlier, boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after Christmas.', 'The gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms.', 'Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.'], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'The summary sentence does not deviate from the facts presented in the related sentences.', 'error type': 'No Error'}, {'summary sentence': 'This surge contributed to an 8% annual sales increase, the best since 1999, according to the Commerce Department.', 'related sentence(s) from the document': ['Sales climbed 8% for the year, the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added.'], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'The summary sentence does not deviate from the facts presented in the related sentence.', 'error type': 'No Error'}, {'summary sentence': \"December's total spending reached $349.4 billion, and annual sales surpassed $4 trillion for the first time.\", 'related sentence(s) from the document': ['The increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn).', 'Sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion'], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'All statements in the summary sentence align with the content of the related sentences.', 'error type': 'No Error'}, {'summary sentence': 'Excluding autos, December sales rose 0.3%, with home furnishings up 2.2% and non-store retailers up 1.9%.', 'related sentence(s) from the document': [\"However, if automotives are excluded from December's data, retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month.\", 'Home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well, rising 2.2%.', 'But as well as hitting the shops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%.'], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'The summary sentence is fully validated against the related sentences.', 'error type': 'No Error'}, {'summary sentence': 'Despite strong sales, the Federal Reserve is expected to continue its measured interest rate hikes.', 'related sentence(s) from the document': ['However, analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the Federal Reserve Bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises.', \"'Consumers for now remain willing to spend freely, sustaining the US expansion.

It is the name of a legal doctrine which governs insurance contracts. This means that all parties to an insurance contract must deal in good faith, making a full declaration of all material facts in the insurance proposal. This contrasts with the legal doctrine of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware).\nThus the insured must reveal the exact nature and potential of the risks that he transfers to the insurer, while at the same time the insurer must make sure that the potential contract fits the needs of, and benefits, the assured.\nA higher duty is exacted from parties to an insurance contract than from parties to most other contracts in order to ensure the disclosure of all material facts so that the contract may accurately reflect the actual risk being undertaken.\nInsurance is a contract of speculation... The special facts, upon which the contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only: the under-writer trusts to his representation, and proceeds upon confidence that he does not keep back any circumstances in his knowledge, to mislead the under-writer into a belief that the circumstance does not exist... Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary.\nSee, generally, Parkington, ed., MacGillivray and Parkington On Insurance Law, 8th ed. (1988) para. 544; Brown and Menezes, Insurance Law in Canada, 2d ed. (1991) pp. 8-9; and 25 Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed. para. 365 et seq.\nThe fact that a contract is one of utmost good faith does not however mean that it gives rise to a general fiduciary relationship. The relationship between insured and insurer is not akin to the relationship between, say, guardian and ward, principal and agent, or trustee and beneficiary. In these latter instances, the inherent character of the relationship is such that the law has traditionally imported general fiduciary obligations. The insurer-insured relationship is contractual; the parties are parties to an arms-length agreement. The principle of uberrima fides does not affect the arms-length nature of the agreement, and cannot be used to find a general fiduciary relationship. The insurance contract, as noted above, imposes certain specific obligations on its parties. These obligations, however, do not import general fiduciary duties into each and every insurance relationship. Before such fiduciary obligations can be imported there must be specific circumstances in the relationship that call for their imposition.\nSummary:\nUberrima fides, meaning 'utmost good faith,' is a legal doctrine governing insurance contracts, requiring all parties to fully disclose material facts. This contrasts with caveat emptor, where the buyer must beware. Insured individuals must reveal the risks they transfer to insurers, who must ensure the contract benefits the assured. A higher duty of disclosure is required in insurance contracts to accurately reflect the risk. The insured's knowledge of special facts is crucial, and good faith prohibits concealing information to mislead the underwriter. Despite this, the insurer-insured relationship is not a general fiduciary one, unlike guardian-ward or trustee-beneficiary relationships. It remains an arms-length agreement, and uberrima fides does not create fiduciary duties unless specific circumstances warrant them.

This suggested he was likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if he left Britain, it said. An identical letter has been sent to Feroz Abbasi, the men's solicitor says.\nIt is not known whether the other two men released from the Cuba detention camp in January - Richard Belmar and Moazzam Begg - have also received letters. The government is implementing the rarely used Royal Prerogative in order to withdraw the men's passports. It is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. The letter, from the Home Office, says: \"I am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the United States, the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that, on leaving the United Kingdom, you would take part in activities against the United Kingdom, or allied targets.\"\nThe Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases.\nThe Liberal Democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the US in order for the men to be allowed home from Guantanamo Bay.\nHome Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. He added: \"The power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and I find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time.\" He said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the Royal Prerogative. The Liberal Democrats have promised to raise the issue in Parliament.\nAmnesty International UK also questioned whether the decisions had been based on \"torture evidence\" obtained at Guantanamo Bay. \"Furthermore, we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the UK in the detention of UK residents and nationals and possibly many others at Guantanamo Bay,\" said director Kate Allen. The men's solicitor, Louise Christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. But the Pentagon told BBC News US policy \"condemns and prohibits\" torture and said there was no evidence that any British detainee was tortured or abused. Mr Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London, was taken to Guantanamo Bay after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001. Mr Mubanga, 29, from north London, was originally detained in Zambia.\nSummary:\nThe UK government has denied passports to Martin Mubanga and Feroz Abbasi, two British men freed from Guantanamo Bay, citing evidence from the US suggesting they might engage in actions against the UK or its allies if they leave Britain. The Home Office used the Royal Prerogative to withdraw their passports before the evidence was gathered, a power rarely invoked since 1947. It is unclear if Richard Belmar and Moazzam Begg, also released from Guantanamo, received similar letters. The Liberal Democrats suspect this is part of a security agreement with the US and demand assurances that evidence wasn't obtained through torture. Amnesty International UK and the men's solicitor, Louise Christian, also question the evidence's legitimacy. The Pentagon denies any British detainee was tortured. Abbasi, from Croydon, was captured in Afghanistan in 2001, while Mubanga, from north London, was detained in Zambia.\n<|end_header_id|>:[{'summary sentence': 'The UK government has denied passports to Martin Mubanga and Feroz Abbasi, two British men freed from Guantanamo Bay, citing evidence from the US suggesting they might engage in actions against the UK or its allies if they leave Britain.', 'related sentence(s) from the document': ['The government has written to two of the British men freed from Guantanamo Bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.', 'A letter sent to Martin Mubanga said his British passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the US.', 'This suggested he was likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if he left Britain, it said.', \"An identical letter has been sent to Feroz Abbasi, the men's solicitor says.\"], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'The summary sentence is supported by the related sentences.', 'error type': 'No Error'}, {'summary sentence': 'The Home Office used the Royal Prerogative to withdraw their passports before the evidence was gathered, a power rarely invoked since 1947.', 'related sentence(s) from the document': [\"The government is implementing the rarely used Royal Prerogative in order to withdraw the men's passports.\", 'It is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976.'], 'supported or not': 'NO', 'reason': \"This sentence is not supported by the related sentence(s).\\n- Location: 'The Royal Prerogative was used before the evidence was gathered'.\\n- Explanation: The summary incorrectly states that the Royal Prerogative was used before the evidence was gathered, suggesting a lack of basis for the decision to withdraw the passports.\\n- Correction: The Home Office used the Royal Prerogative, a power rarely invoked since 1947, to withdraw their passports.\", 'error type': 'Discourse Link Error'}, {'summary sentence': 'It is unclear if Richard Belmar and Moazzam Begg, also released from Guantanamo, received similar letters.', 'related sentence(s) from the document': ['It is not known whether the other two men released from the Cuba detention camp in January - Richard Belmar and Moazzam Begg - have also received letters.'], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'The summary sentence faithfully reflects the related sentence.', 'error type': 'No Error'}, {'summary sentence': \"The Liberal Democrats suspect this is part of a security agreement with the US and demand assurances that evidence wasn't obtained through torture.\", 'related sentence(s) from the document': ['The Liberal Democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the US in order for the men to be allowed home from Guantanamo Bay.', 'Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture.'], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'All statements in the summary sentence align with the content of the related sentences.', 'error type': 'No Error'}, {'summary sentence': \"Amnesty International UK and the men's solicitor, Louise Christian, also question the evidence's legitimacy.\", 'related sentence(s) from the document': [\"Amnesty International UK also questioned whether the decisions had been based on 'torture evidence' obtained at Guantanamo Bay.\", \"The men's solicitor, Louise Christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture.\"], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'All content in the summary sentence is accurately derived from the related sentences.', 'error type': 'No Error'}, {'summary sentence': 'The Pentagon denies any British detainee was tortured.', 'related sentence(s) from the document': [\"But the Pentagon told BBC News US policy 'condemns and prohibits' torture and said there was no evidence that any British detainee was tortured or abused.\"], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'Every detail in the summary sentence is rooted in the related sentence.', 'error type': 'No Error'}, {'summary sentence': 'Abbasi, from Croydon, was captured in Afghanistan in 2001, while Mubanga, from north London, was detained in Zambia.', 'related sentence(s) from the document': ['Mr Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London, was taken to Guantanamo Bay after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001.', 'Mr Mubanga, 29, from north London, was originally detained in Zambia.'], 'supported or not': 'YES', 'reason': 'The summary sentence adheres completely to the information in the related sentences.', 'error type': 'No Error'}]"}

The pair arrived with former coach Christos Tzekos to give evidence at the Hellenic Olympic Committee's offices. A decision is expected to be announced before the end of February. Whatever the ruling, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, who was head of the Greek Olympic team at the Athens Games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other Greek sports officials and athletes. \"I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution,\" said Papadoyiannakis. \"Whatever the athletes have done, we must not forget that they have offered us great moments.\" Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m.\nThey withdrew from the Athens Games last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. The pair spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. The five-member tribunal, assembled by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics, is also examining allegations that Kenteris and Thanou avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games. Tzekos was also banned for two years by the IAAF. He faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. All three, who have repeatedly denied the allegations, have also been charged by a Greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. A trial date has not been set. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as \"unacceptable\". But Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing. \"We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical,\" he said. \"There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights. \"There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.\"\nSummary:\nGreek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou appeared before an independent tribunal to determine if their bans for missing drug tests before the Athens Olympics should stand.
