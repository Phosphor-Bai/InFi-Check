Here is a document with a corresponding summary. Your task is to analyze the summary sentence by sentence. For each sentence in the summary, provide the exact sentences from the document that supports the summary sentence. If the summary comes from multiple sentences, report all sentences.
You should ensure that sentences are considered as individual units based on punctuation. Specifically:
- Treat each sentence as ending at a period (.), question mark (?), or exclamation mark (!), even if multiple sentences are enclosed within quotation marks.
- Do not truncate any sentence. If a portion of a sentence is extracted (e.g., ending at a comma, semicolon, or any punctuation other than ., ?, !), you must include the rest of the sentence so that the entire sentence is fully reproduced.
