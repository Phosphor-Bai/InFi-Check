Example Document:
The former police chief of the school police force in Uvalde, Tex., has been indicted in connection with the botched response to the 2022 shooting that left 19 students and two teachers dead at Robb Elementary.
Uvalde County jail officials confirmed that Pedro “Pete” Arredondo was booked at the facility on 10 felony counts of abandoning or endangering a child shortly before 5 p.m. local time on Thursday. Arredondo’s bond was set at $100,000, or $10,000 per charge. He posted bail shortly after being booked.
Local media reported a former officer, Adrian Gonzales, was also indicted. The charges were first reported by the San Antonio Express-News. District Attorney Christina Mitchell did not return requests for comment.
The officers are the first to face criminal charges in a shooting that sparked outrage over both the violence of the 18-year-old gunman and law enforcement’s lengthy delay in entering the classroom and killing him. Texas leaders initially praised the law enforcement response but later acknowledged officers had waited 77 minutes to confront the gunman.
Legal experts said the charges appear to mark an unprecedented application of the child-endangerment statute and noted that the 10 counts are probably in reference to the 10 children who survived the deadly attack that day by pretending to be dead or hiding among the dead.

These are the first criminal charges in the case, highlighting law enforcement's delayed action during the incident.
