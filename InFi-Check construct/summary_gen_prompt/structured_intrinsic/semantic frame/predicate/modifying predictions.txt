Error Type: Intrinsic/Semantic Frame/Predicate
Method: Modifying Predictions
Few Shot: No
Instruction: 
1. Analyze the document and identify sentences that contain future predictions (e.g., those using modal verbs like 'will,' 'might,' or phrases like 'predict,' 'suppose'). 
2. Select a sentence where the prediction is the main clause, not just a subordinate clause, and modifying the prediction into a factual statement will result in the most significant change in meaning. You can modify this sentence so that the prediction is completely transformed into a factual statement about an event that has already occurred. Ensure the modified sentence is grammatically correct and fully removes any speculative language.
3. Based on the changed sentence, modify some part of the summary to include the fake information in the changed sentence, so the summary cannot be fully supported by the origin document.
